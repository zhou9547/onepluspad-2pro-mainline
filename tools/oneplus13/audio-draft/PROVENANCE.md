# AW88461 offline component

Compile and synthetic fault/parser tests only. No phone DT references, firmware,
profile, calibration, service, module-install target or boot image is supplied.
The running phone amplifier identity and its protected owner-matched tuning
remain unverified. Successful compilation does not authorize amplifier loading.

The local draft adds a restricted legacy ACF preflight before the shared parser.
The preflight and synthetic tests were prepared by Codex. Power controls are
regenerated from the actual staged driver for each check, never from an old
generated copy. Poll timing, worker/DAPM concurrency, electrical behavior and
acoustic protection are not established by the host stubs.

The compile job uses the existing phone kernel pin
`yzddmr6/linux-sm8750-erhai` commit
`7a81d184e3098624d4342d8f4eff5e23674bcc9f` and its AW88395 shared parser.
It builds objects only, leaving the normal phone/Pad build paths unchanged.
