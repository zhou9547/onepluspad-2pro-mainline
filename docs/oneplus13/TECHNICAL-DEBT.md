# Technical debt (single register for the phone)

| ID | Temporary choice / location | Reason and impact | Removal criterion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D01 | Community low-memory fallback in the default DTS | The owner-specific calibrated candidate now uses actual 15-bank runtime RAM and excludes every stock protected interval offline, but bootloader fixups and actual RAM use are untested | Verify memory/fixups through a bounded RAM boot before promoting the private calibration to the default board profile |
| D02 | Firmware framebuffer in phone DTS | Enables testing inherited display without inventing a panel sequence; resource lifetime and pixel format are not hardware verified | Port and verify native phone panel/DSC/timings/power sequence |
| D03 | Pad-maintained SM8750 kernel as a pinned platform base | Reuses platform fixes only; its board support is not phone support | Track upstream and replace with a maintained phone kernel after equivalent validation |
| D04 | Sleep targets masked in GNOME staging rootfs | Avoid entering untested phone suspend/resume paths; ordinary standby is unavailable | Cold-boot and repeated suspend/resume tests on the phone with independent recovery |

Unimplemented peripherals are tracked in STATUS.md, not represented as working.
